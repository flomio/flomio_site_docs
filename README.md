Getting Started with Slate
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or OS X** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.2.5 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Getting Set Up

1. Add yourself as a contributor to this project.
2. Clone to your hard drive with `git clone git@github.com:yummytech/DeveloperHub.git`
3. `cd DeveloperHub`
4. Initialize and start Slate.

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server
```

```shell
# to deploy to active site
./deploy.sh
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567.

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Docker).
